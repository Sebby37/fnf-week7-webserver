# fnf-week7-webserver
The week 7 browser version of Friday Night Funkin with a python script that runs it locally as a web server

The week 7 files can be found at [this repo ](https://github.com/hyperwood/hyperwood.github.io/tree/main/fnf7) (I would have included them with this repo, but they are too big for Github

An online version can be played at the above's github site [here](https://hyperwood.github.io/fnf7/)

The default browser for this is firefox developer edition. This is because I couldn't get it to work through Brave. If you want to use another browser, open the "config.ini" file (it will be created when you first run the program) and paste the directory where your browser of choice is.

Windows may treat the compiled releases as a virus. This is due to the way it was compiled (through pyinstaller). If you don't want to use the executables, clone/download the repo and then download the fnf7.zip file in the releases tab and extract that to the folder the python files are located.
